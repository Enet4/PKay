# PKay

PKay is an action survival game where you control a Pong paddle to protect the city from incoming projectiles and save your kind.

**Still under development.**

Built using the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).

## Instructions

On each wave, protect your base at all costs, by sending incoming balls back to the rightmost edge of the screen. Between waves, you can purchase upgrades to your paddle using your accumulated credits.

Using the **keyboard**: Use the directional keys to move the paddle up and down. Press Enter to select. Control fires the gun (once unlocked). Esc pauses the game.

Using a **game controller**: Use the directional pad to move the paddle up and down. Use the left button in the right-hand pad (square in PS) to select things, and the bottom button (cross in PS) to fire the gun (once unlocked). Press the start button (or equivalent) to pause the game.
